## **2\. Information We Collect**

### **a. Personal Information**

We may collect the following information to create and manage your account:

* Full name, phone number, email address, and physical address  
* Government-issued ID or selfie for identity verification (KYC)  
* Bank details, transaction history, and account information

### **b. Technical & Usage Data**

We automatically collect technical data such as:

* Device identifiers, operating system, browser type, and app version  
* Interaction data (app screens viewed, buttons tapped, feature usage)  
* Crash logs and performance diagnostics (through Firebase or similar tools)

### **c. Location Data**

With your permission, we collect **precise location** data to verify addresses and enhance security using **OkHi** and similar verification tools.  
 Location data is collected only as needed for functionality and is not shared for marketing purposes.

### **d. Biometric & Sensitive Data**

We use biometric authentication (Face ID or fingerprint) for secure login and identity verification.  
 Biometric data is processed securely on your device’s hardware (Secure Enclave) and is **never stored or transmitted** to DgnRavePay servers.

### **e. TrueDepth and Face Data**

Our app may use Apple’s **TrueDepth camera APIs** to enable secure and seamless authentication experiences such as **Face ID login** or **facial verification during KYC (Know Your Customer)** processes.

* **Data Collection:**  
   The TrueDepth camera analyzes facial features to confirm identity or enable authentication. This information is processed *in real time* on your device.  
* **Data Usage:**  
   The facial data captured by the TrueDepth camera is **used only for verification or authentication purposes** and is **not stored, shared, or transmitted** to DgnRavePay’s servers or any third parties.  
* **Data Storage:**  
   TrueDepth and Face ID data are **secured within Apple’s Secure Enclave** and remain fully controlled by your device’s operating system. DgnRavePay **cannot access** or **store** this information.  
* **Third-Party Access:**  
   None. TrueDepth data is processed locally and never leaves your device.

By using Face ID or facial recognition features, you consent to this local processing for secure authentication.

### **f. Contacts Access**

With your consent, we access your phone’s contact list to:

* Help you send or request payments to existing users, and  
* Invite contacts who are not yet registered.  
   Contact information is used only for this purpose and is not stored or shared externally.

### **g. Cookies and Similar Technologies**

We use cookies and local storage to remember your preferences, analyze traffic, and improve user experience.
