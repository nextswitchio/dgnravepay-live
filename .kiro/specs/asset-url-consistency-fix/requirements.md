# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has inconsistent asset URL generation, where some images load from `/build/assets/` (correct Vite-processed assets) while others load from `/assets/` (incorrect, causing 404 errors). This feature will standardize all asset handling to ensure consistent URL generation and proper asset loading across the entire application.

## Glossary

- **Vite**: The build tool used for processing and bundling frontend assets
- **Asset_Helper**: Custom Laravel helper class for generating domain-aware asset URLs
- **Storage_Assets**: User-uploaded files stored in the storage directory
- **Static_Assets**: Images and other assets stored in the resources/images directory
- **Build_Assets**: Assets processed by Vite and output to public/build/assets/
- **Application**: The Laravel web application serving the assets

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want all images to load correctly, so that I can view the complete website content without broken images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application serves any static asset, THE Application SHALL generate URLs that point to the correct Vite-processed asset location
2. THE Application SHALL ensure all Static_Assets are processed through Vite build system
3. IF an asset URL is generated, THEN THE Application SHALL use consistent URL patterns across all views
4. THE Application SHALL serve all Static_Assets from the `/build/assets/` directory path
5. WHEN a user visits any page, THE Application SHALL display all images without 404 errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent asset helper functions, so that all team members use the same approach for asset URL generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL provide unified helper functions for all asset types
2. WHEN generating Storage_Assets URLs, THE Application SHALL use domain-aware URL generation
3. WHEN generating Static_Assets URLs, THE Application SHALL use Vite asset processing
4. THE Application SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing asset references
5. THE Application SHALL provide clear documentation for asset helper usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable asset serving in production, so that the website performs consistently across different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL generate correct asset URLs regardless of domain configuration
2. WHEN deployed to production, THE Application SHALL serve all assets with proper cache headers
3. THE Application SHALL handle both www and non-www domain variants correctly
4. IF an asset path is invalid, THEN THE Application SHALL provide fallback handling
5. THE Application SHALL maintain asset URL consistency across HTTP and HTTPS protocols

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want uploaded images to display correctly, so that blog posts and dynamic content appear properly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Storage_Assets are referenced in views, THE Application SHALL generate accessible URLs
2. THE Application SHALL distinguish between Static_Assets and Storage_Assets appropriately
3. WHEN a Storage_Asset is missing, THE Application SHALL provide graceful fallback behavior
4. THE Application SHALL maintain proper file permissions for Storage_Assets
5. THE Application SHALL support both absolute and relative asset path references
